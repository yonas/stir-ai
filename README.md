<h1>STIR A.I.</h1>
<h2>Spatial Temporal Imaginative Rational Artificial Intelligence</h2>

The goal of STIR A.I. is to create the foundation of an artificial intelligence that can demonstrate the following:

<h3>1. Awareness</h3>
<ul>
<li>Awareness of space</li>
<li>Awareness of time</li>
<li>Awareness of self in relation to space and time</li>
<li>Awareness of the physical Universe in relation to space and time</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Capabilities</h3>
<h4>i) Imagination</h4>
<ul>
<li>Ability to deduce categories through similarities</li>
<li>Ability to differenciate categories from instances</li>
</ul>


<h4>ii) Spatial</h4>
<ul>
<li>Ability to deduce the utility of objects</li>
<li>Ability to achieve goals through coordinated displacement of objects</li>
<li>Ability to deduce goals through observation of the displacement of objects</li>
</ul>

<h4>iii) Rational</h4>
<ul>
<li>Ability to deduce principals from observed processes</li>
</ul>

<h4>iv) Temporal</h4>
<ul>
<li>Ability to recognize an event as before and after</li>
<li>Ability to deduce the cause of an event</li>
</ul>

The ultimate achievement is to create one map that the STIR A.I. can use to learn anything.

This map is comprised of four axis, creating four quadrents:
