<h1>STIR A.I.</h1>
<h2>Spatial Temporal Imaginative Rational Artificial Intelligence</h2>

The goal of STIR A.I. is to create the basics a artificial intelligence that can demonstrate:

<h3>Awareness</h3>
<ul>
<li>Awareness of space</li>
<li>Awareness of time</li>
<li>Awareness of self in relation to space and time</li>
<li>Awareness of the physical Universe in relation to space and time</li>
</ul>

<h3>Capabilities</h3>
<h4>Imaginative</h4>
<ul>
<li>Ability to deduce categorizes through similarities</li>
<li>Ability to differenciate categories from instances</li>
</ul>


<h4>Spatial</h4>
<ul>
<li>Ability to deduce the utility of objects</li>
<li>Ability to achieve goals through coordinated displacement of objects</li>
<li>Ability to deduce goals through observation of the displacement of objects</li>
</ul>

<h4>Rational</h4>
<ul>
<li>Ability to deduce principals from observed processes</li>
</ul>

<h4>Temporal</h4>
<ul>
<li>Ability to recognize an event as before and after</li>
<li>Ability to deduce the cause of an event</li>
</ul>

The ultimate achievement is to create one map that the STIR A.I. can use to learn anything.

This map is comprised of four axis, creating four quadrents:

<h3>Axis</h3>
<ul>
<li>Space</li>
<li>Time</li>
<li>Imagination</li>
<li>Rational</li>
</ul>
