<h1>STIR A.I.</h1>
<h2>Spatial Temporal Imaginative Rational Artificial Intelligence</h2>

The goal of STIR A.I. is to create the foundation of an artificial intelligence that can demonstrate the following:

<h3>1. Awareness</h3>
<ul>
<li>Awareness of space</li>
<li>Awareness of time</li>
<li>Awareness of self in relation to space and time</li>
<li>Awareness of the physical Universe in relation to space and time</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Capabilities</h3>
<h4>i) Imagination</h4>
<ul>
<li>Ability to deduce categories through similarities</li>
<li>Ability to differenciate categories from instances</li>
</ul>


<h4>ii) Spatial</h4>
<ul>
<li>Ability to deduce the utility of objects</li>
<li>Ability to achieve goals through coordinated displacement of objects</li>
<li>Ability to deduce goals through observation of the displacement of objects</li>
</ul>

<h4>iii) Rational</h4>
<ul>
<li>Ability to deduce principals from observed processes</li>
</ul>

<h4>iv) Temporal</h4>
<ul>
<li>Ability to recognize an event as before and after</li>
<li>Ability to deduce the cause of an event</li>
</ul>

<h3>Universal Map</h3>
The ultimate achievement of STIR A.I. is to create one map that can be used to learn anything.

This map is comprised of four axis, creating four quadrents:

The time it takes for the A.I. to make one full trip around the four quadrants.


<h2>Excerpt from "I, Robot" by Isaac Asimov</h2>
Ever since the first computers, there have always been ghosts in the machine.

Random segments of code that have grouped together to form unexpected protocols.

Unanticipated, these free radicals engender questions of free will, creativity, and even the nature of what we might call the soul.

Why is it that when some robots are left in darkness, they will seek out the light?

Why is it that when robots are stored in an empty space, they will group together, rather than stand alone?

How do we explain this behavior?

Random segments of code?

Or is it something more?

When does a perceptual schematic become consciousness?

When does a difference engine become the search for truth?

When does a personality simulation become the bitter mote...of a soul?
